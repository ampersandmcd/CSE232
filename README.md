# CSE 232

This repository serves as a project archive from my work in CSE 232: Object-Oriented Programming II in C++ at Michigan State University as taken during the Fall 2018 semester with [Dr. Bill Punch](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/punch).

Because CSE 232 is now taught by [Dr. Josh Nahum](http://www.nahum.us/) with a revised curriculum and new projects, the code included in this repository is in compliance with Michigan State University's Code of Honor:

> “​As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor in ownership is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.​”
