# CSE 232

## Overview

This repository serves as a project archive from my work in CSE 232: Object-Oriented Programming II in C++ at Michigan State University as taken during the Fall 2018 semester with [Dr. Bill Punch](https://www.egr.msu.edu/people/profile/punch).

Because CSE 232 is now taught by [Dr. Josh Nahum](http://www.nahum.us/) with a revised curriculum and new projects, the code included in this repository is in compliance with Michigan State University's Code of Honor:

> "​As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor in ownership is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.​"

Dr. Bill Punch expressly granted me permission via email to publish this repository:

> "You are free to publish on GitHub the work you did and show it off to anyone you like. You did the work so you should be free to do as you wish. My assumption when I taught the course was that anyone would have access to old projects anyway so I always tried to come up with new material."
